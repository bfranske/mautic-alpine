= Mautic Alpine

== Introduction

This repository contains files used to build and run a copy of the Mautic software on an Alpine docker image. It is a work in progress.

== Building the Mautic Docker image

. To build a Docker image containing Apache, PHP, and the Mautic software run the command `+docker build -t mautic-alpine:5.0.2 .+`
. If you need to remove previously built images and containers all at once use the command `+docker system prune -a+` but be careful as this will remove everything (not just mautic-alpine)!

== Setting Up the Mautic Docker 

== Running the Mautic Docker

. To run a test copy of the software use the `+docker compose -f mautic.yml up+` command. You can quit this with a CTRL+C
. To run a copy of the software in the background use the `+docker compose -f mautic.yml up --detach+` command.
. To stop a background copy of the software use the `+docker compose -f mautic.yml down+` command.
